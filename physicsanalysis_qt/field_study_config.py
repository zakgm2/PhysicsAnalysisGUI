"""
field_study_config.py
-----------------------
Local configuration for the generic text-field-study feature (see
loaders/text_field_study.py, PhysicsLibrary.run_field_study_pipeline).

Which fields exist, how they're grouped, and which pair up is entirely
study-specific — so none of that lives in this repo's source. It's
stored in a small JSON file in the user's home directory instead,
completely outside any git repo. Built via FieldAssignmentDialog (shown
right after picking a study folder, using that folder's own field
names) rather than requiring the fields to already be known/typed
anywhere first; saved here so the next folder you open pre-fills from it.
