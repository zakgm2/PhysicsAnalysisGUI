update_check.py
-----------------
Checks GitHub for a newer version of PhysicsAnalysis and PhysicsLibrary
than what's currently running — the same check, the same behavior,
whether this is a dev/editable install or a packaged build. There's no
installer to silently run (this project ships a plain onefile exe, no
Inno Setup/MSI/etc.), so there's no safe way to auto-apply an update
without user interaction — the app can only tell you one exists.

Both an available PhysicsAnalysis update and an available PhysicsLibrary
update are purely a splash status line (UpdateCheckWorker.checked's
"status") — never a blocking dialog. A modal "Update Available" popup
used to gate launch here; it's gone now, both because a launch-blocking
popup is worse than just telling you and moving on, and because a
QMessageBox whose only buttons are ActionRole/AcceptRole has no button
Qt can treat as the window's close/Escape action, so its titlebar X
silently did nothing — a genuinely stuck-feeling dead end, not just an
annoying one.

Neither project reliably uses GitHub Releases (PhysicsLibrary currently
has none at all), so "latest version" prefers the tag of the repo's
latest published Release when one exists, and falls back to the version
string committed in pyproject.toml on the default branch when it
doesn't — covering a project whether or not its owner bothers publishing
formal releases.

The GitHub calls run on a background QThread so the splash's pulse
animation and event loop stay responsive while they're in flight.
