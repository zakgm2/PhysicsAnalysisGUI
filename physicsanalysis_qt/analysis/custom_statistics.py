"""
analysis/custom_statistics.py
--------------------------------
"Custom Statistics" picker — the home for dataset-specific analysis
tools that don't belong in the double-click Analysis dropdown (which is
reserved for things that work on any loaded source, analyzing whichever
signal the "Plot:" dropdown currently shows: FFT, AUC, Curve Fit,
Z-Score — see analysis/dispatch.py. Custom tools here instead always
analyze the corrected/normalized signal regardless of what's displayed.
Replaces the old
"Advanced Analysis ▾" toolbar menu with a proper picker window so a
dataset with no applicable custom tool can say so explicitly instead of
just not showing a menu.

Adding a future custom tool means adding one entry to _CUSTOM_TOOLS, not
new UI plumbing.
