analysis/analysis_picker.py
----------------------------
The toolbar's "Analysis" button — replaces the old mode dropdown. Clicking
it always opens this menu, and going back to it cancels whatever tool was
armed: the menu always starts from the plain plot, so closing it with the X
(or Close) just leaves you there. Pick a tool to arm it, and a toast says
what to do on the graph next. The picked tool is armed for ONE run: the
next double-click on the graph (Curve Fit: the next two clicks) runs it
and it disarms itself, like Splice.

Tick "Persist through trials" at the top of the menu and the tool stays
armed after each run instead, so you can go from one trial to the next by
double-clicking each in turn. Only then does a small panel with a "Done"
button sit in the window's bottom-left corner (toasts.show_pinned_panel):
press it to turn the tool off. It never times out and toasts don't touch
it. Every graph window a tool opens has a "Done" button at the bottom too
(add_done_button). Closing a graph window with its X instead leaves a
persistent tool armed for the next trial.

The analysis window (seconds either side of the point you double-click) is
set from this menu too, rather than from its own top-bar button.

Which tool is armed is ctx.analysis_mode: None, or the "mode" of one of the
_TOOLS below. analysis/dispatch.py's analysis_type() launches FFT/Z-Score/AUC
from it, and the three engines' click handlers read it for Curve Fit; each
calls disarm_analysis() the moment it runs.

Adding a tool means one entry in _TOOLS (plus wiring its launch into
dispatch.analysis_type, or its click handling into the engines, and a Done
button on its graph window).
